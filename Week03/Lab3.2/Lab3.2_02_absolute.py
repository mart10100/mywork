# Lab3.2_02_absolute.py
# This program takes an input number and outputs its absolut value. 
# Author: Matthew Arthur (with help from lab3.2 step 2)

#The comments shown in the lab helped to clear things up about what way the number is to be cast (if that's how you say it correctly)
number = float(input("Enter a number: "))
absolute_value = abs(number)
print('The absolute value of {} is {}.'.format(number, absolute_value))
