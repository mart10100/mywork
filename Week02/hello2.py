# hello2.py
# This program reads and prints out hello (name), nice to meet you
# Author: Matthew Arthur 

# From lab 2.2 step 11:

name = input("Enter your name: ")
# print('Hello '+ name) - This has been made into a comment so that "Hello 'Name'" does not repeat in the output. 

# Adding "nice to meet you" after hello "name": ()

print('Hello '+ name + '\nNice to meet you.')
